# Artful.ly OSE

Welcome to Artful.ly OSE

## About

Artful.ly Open Source Edition is the core code of the Artful.ly app downloadable for free and ready for you to roll up your sleeves and build a custom management system for your arts business. The Artful.ly OSE framework gives software developers a base from which they can add features, integrate with other apps, and much more!

## Before You Begin

You'll want the following running on your machine:

- Ruby 1.9.3
- MySQL 

## Usage

Artful.ly Open Source Engine is a Rails Engine.  **It is not intended to be mounted into an existing project** but rather to be used with the reference implementation [here](http://www.github.com/fracturedatlas/artfully_app)

## Branch strategy

Master is the current development branch.  Every effort is made to make master tidy and working at all times but it is the edge and problems do happen.  For any stable production applications, you'll *absolutely* want to be pointing to a published, stable gem.  A list can be found [on Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/artfully_ose)

## Contributing

This is coming soon, we promise.
